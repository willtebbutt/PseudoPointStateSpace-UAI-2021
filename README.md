# Combining Pseudo-Point and State Space Approximations for Sum-Separable Gaussian Processes

Code for review at UAI 2021. Reasonable attempts have been made to anonymise the code.

All experiments should be run from the top level of this repo -- don't navigate into the scripts directory.

You must have a working version of Julia installed to run this code -- experiments were run using version 1.5.3, a copy of which can be obtained from https://julialang.org/downloads/ .
I recommend running these experiments using version 1.5.3.
